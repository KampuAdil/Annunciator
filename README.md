# Annunciator

This Annunciator is a Basic Model to Automate the Process and Recognize the Fault
Whenever there is a change of input contacts from Normally Open to Close or from Normally Close to Open position, annunciator changes from rest condition to alarm condition.
Hence there is an immediate recognition of fault input which will have a corresponding visual and audio alarm as per the particular selected program sequence.

The base unit of alarm annunciator has four programmable keys for Mute, Acknowledge, Reset & Test function. On pressing the Mute key the internal buzzer can be deactivated. Acknowledge key is used to accept the fault condition, Reset key enables to reset the alarm annunciator to its default state and Test key helps to perform the complete test of the system
